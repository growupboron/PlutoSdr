Ver 1.0.1x	Initial release good control of all RF parameters for both Rx
		abd Tx. Some useful tests, but see ToDo.

Ver 1.0.2	Corrections and modifications with inclusion of LGPLv2 license 
		conditions

ToDo:
*) Incomplete testing of PlutoSdr 
  - cannot see how to test code without the device connected
